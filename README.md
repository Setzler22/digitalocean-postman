[DigitalOcean][do-api]-Postman Collection
========================================
Postman Collection for [DigitalOcean API][do-api]

This repo is a placeholder to maintain [DO API][do-api] Postman Collections (not owned by DO). It has a list of requests,
with collection & environment variables and response examples. Contribution to [DigitalOcean on GitHub][do-github] and as most of the descriptions are copied from
beautifully & well documented API, please refer the [Official DigitalOcean API][do-api]. This is just Postman collection!!

>> The [DigitalOcean API][do-api] allows you to manage Droplets and resources within the DigitalOcean cloud 
>> in a simple, programmatic way using conventional HTTP requests. The endpoints are intuitive and
>> powerful, allowing you to easily make calls to retrieve information or to execute actions.
